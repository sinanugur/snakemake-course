# Sample dataset for Snakemake Novice Bioinformatics course

This sample dataset is intended for use with the course found at:

https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/snakemake-novice-bioinformatics

# Short read data

These originate from a dataset lodged in [ArrayExpress at EBI][1]:

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-4044

the files for any purpose without attribution. However, if you do re-use the dataset it is basic
academic courtesy to state the accession *E-MTAB-4044*, and cite the paper:

The subset of the dataset included here was selected by the authors of the Snakemake lesson.

# Yeast transcriptome

This was downloaded from the [Ensembl yeast database][3], specifically this location:

https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/fasta/saccharomyces_cerevisiae/cdna/

The description provided by Ensemble states that:

> The data on this site is a direct import of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) dataset for
> the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C genome. The assembly provided is R64-1-1, supplemented with
> additional cross-references and annotations. The protein-coding and non-coding gene model
> annotation was imported from SGD in April 2018. This gene set is based on Liachko et al. 2013

The [SGD website][4] provides full information on appropriate citation of their genome builds,
but the appropriate papers to cite regarding this reference sequence are:
